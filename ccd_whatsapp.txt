12/06/25, 12:35 pm - Manisha CS04: Guys many were having confusions regarding several sections in superset

1.Certificate section refers to the certificates of any courses you have done, workshops attended, competitions participated etc

2.Project section : Include projects if you have any

There are many sections in the superset but these aren't mandatory. If you don't have anything to upload or don't know what to upload (like subjects,my -documents, write-ups, patents,publications etc) leave it blank. 

IN SHORT : Anything mentioned as mandatory must be filled. RESUME IS A MUST AND YOU MUST NOT AVOID THAT. <This message was edited>

The resume you upload must be final-quality — with your photo, CGPA, and all relevant details properly filled. If your resume is incomplete, improperly formatted, or uploaded just for the sake of meeting the deadline, your profile can get rejected.
And once it’s rejected, the re-approval process is extremely slow and difficult, which can cause unnecessary delays and complications.
When we said you can "update" your resume, we meant adding new projects, updated CGPA, certifications, or achievements. So please keep these in mind before uploading.
14/06/25, 12:02 pm - Goutham CS03: Here is a checklist of all *mandatory* items to do before today 2 pm

☑️Resume(Superset resume builder not recommended)
☑️10th and 12th cert.
☑️All sems marksheet(Single doc)


☑️7/7 basic steps of registration from filling basic details to uploading photo and clicking proceed for placement enrollment.

All students who are planning to participate in the upcoming placement/internship drives are required to *report to campus on 14th July 2025 at 9:00 AM.*
26/06/25, 2:00 pm - Goutham CS03: A mandatory assessment has been scheduled on Superset on *28th June* , Saturday from 8:00 PM onwards. It will be conducted in 3 sessions.

📍Mandatory for all B22 and B23
📌 For more details, check the Assessment tab under Launchpad in Superset.
Ensure timely participation.
26/06/25, 2:35 pm - Manisha CS04: Hey everyone,
We understand that many of you are concerned about the reopening scheduled for July 14th especially those who booked flights and trains.While the date was announced quite late, there’s currently no possibility of it being postponed. We’re still waiting for clarification from CCD regarding whether reporting on the 14th is mandatory to attend the upcoming internship drive, and also whether any companies will be visiting on that day.
Meanwhile, those who can manage, please try your best to report on the 14th.
26/06/25, 4:55 pm - +91 77023 21535: All students planning to attend the *internship drive* this year are required to report back by *17th July* , without exception.

Students who have scored below the cutoff will undergo a mandatory *self sponsered training program* starting from *14th July 2025* . Attendance is compulsory for these students, and no exceptions will be entertained. The list of such students will be released within this week.

Students who are not on the list but wish to attend the training voluntarily are also welcome to join.

 *NB* : The cutoff will be based on the diagnostic test as well as the assessment test scheduled on 28th June.
26/06/25, 4:55 pm - +91 77023 21535: Hope all doubts are clear with this 🙌🏻
27/06/25, 12:38 am - +91 97781 70727 joined using a group link.
27/06/25, 10:12 am - +91 77023 21535: Hey everyone 
Many students have reached out with concerns, so here’s a clarification given by CCD:

Students who score above the cutoff but are unable to report by July 17 due to valid reasons (like ongoing internships, travel from far-off places), can still attend the internship drive. However, please note:

If any companies come before July 21, those who report late will miss out on those opportunities.
So yes, it’s not strictly mandatory for everyone to be present on 17th July , but coming later is at your own risk, as you might miss some company drives.

For students below the cutoff:
You are required to undergo mandatory training starting July 14. Failing to report for that training as instructed may result in missing the internship drive. CCD may consider arranging another training later, but until then, you will not be eligible to participate in any internship drives.

Please plan accordingly so you don’t end up missing out on any valuable opportunities.
27/06/25, 3:45 pm - Goutham CS03: All students who are still not able to view their results of the previous diagnostic test please fill the google sheet below which is to be sent to CCD

“Students should understand that we are trying to improve your employability by conducting tests and training. It’s not to punish you. We are doing all these based on the feedback received from the past recruiters. Several recruiters are not even showing their interest in conducting the drive since the performance of our students was so poor. You should take it in the right spirit and support us. We are planning to conduct many more such assessments throughout the year.”

26/07/25, 2:50 pm - Goutham CS03: ❗All those who applied for Flipkart in Superset and didn't apply for Flipkart via external link before 1pm today❗

Your profile will get blocked after Flipkart OA. This is because CCD has your name since you applied in superset and you wont be able to write the OA since you didn't applied via ext link.

After confirming the 'blocked' status, apology letter and fine should be submitted and from the day of paying fine, for 14 fays your profile will remain blocked...

Anyway you can attend PPT s/OAs/interviews of the companies u apply till tmrw(eg. Wells Fargo, Qualcomm etc.). Only thing is u cant apply for any new companies while u are blocked. <This message was edited>

CCD is strictly against this and any matter regarding placements/internships should be communicated through PRs and PRs will inform the concerned student's name etc to Spocs/FA/CCD....

So basically, from now on cancelling classes/labs due to internship related activities is strictly prohibited and the only thing you can do is to inform any of the PRs and note that no CRs can also contact CCD for the same.

If its urgent, CCD will do the needful by fetching the details of concerned students.

20/08/25, 10:25 pm - Goutham CS03: Guys VISA's proctoring is very strict, so strict that if any other face is detected on the camera, your test responses will not be accepted and would be considered as a malpractice.
So, offline proctoring is not practical and thats why VISA told to CCD that we should do the OA from hostels, eventhough CCD wanted offline OA.
20/08/25, 11:34 pm - Goutham CS03: Guys formals are mandatory for OAs...

24/09/25, 10:04 am - Manisha CS04: Dear Students,
It has come to our notice that some students have received fraudulent emails asking them to register for internship programs by paying money.

For example, one such email was sent from: piyush.virmani@launchedglobal.in.

Please note the following:

Do not respond to such emails or make any payment.

All authentic communication regarding internships, placements, or training will be sent only through the Career and Placement Cell (CCD), NITC, or via your official Placement Representatives.

We urge you to exercise caution and remain vigilant against such scams.


Regards
Team CCD

In connection with the communication workshop, we request you to participate in the pre-workshop survey. This is to better understand:
·      Students’ current knowledge of communication fundamentals.

·      Anticipated challenges in interviews, group discussions, and public speaking.

·      Areas where students need future support (e.g., teamwork, stress management, time management, Armed Forces preparation, etc).

The survey is anonymous and online (Google Form link below) and will provide valuable inputs for tailoring the workshop to students’ actual needs.

Guys,
We had a discussion with CCD Vice Chairperson and he said the people who got aptitude training from December 17-19 *should be here regardedless of any reason* . 

Whether you booked tickets to abroad or to other states to go home doesn't matter, you must be present here on Dec 17-19, otherwise you will be debarred from internship and placement drives from February 2026.

Also, in December you will have internship drive and companies will be coming and you should mandatorily attend all the companies. *Failure to attend any company will be asked and you will be debarred from placement and internship drives from February* .

❗Basically in short: *" Cancel all the tickets even if its a flight, just be here and apply for all the companies whether you are interested or not and attend the training if you got. Otherwise get placed before February. "* ❗

Not interested in a particular software company or I am at home is not considered as a valid reason to not apply for a company.
